Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides a detailed view of the lumbar spine vertebra, discs and nerves, enabling radiologists to assess the presence and severity of these conditions. Proper diagnosis and grading of these conditions help guide treatment and potential surgery to help alleviate back pain and improve overall health and quality of life for patients.
RSNA has teamed with the American Society of Neuroradiology (ASNR) to conduct this competition exploring whether artificial intelligence can be used to aid in the detection and classification of degenerative spine conditions using lumbar spine MR images.
